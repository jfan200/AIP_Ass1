# Student Information

**Course:** COMP90054 AI Planning for Autonomy

**Semester:** Semester 2, 2023


**Student:**

your full name - your student number - your canvas student login

> Replace the lines above with your correct details. Your student number should only be the **numbers**. For example: Guang Hu - 000000 - ghu1. 

**Collaborated With:**

> If you worked with another student, please include their **full name** and ask them to provide you with the **url to their github codebase**. Their codebase should be private, you will not have access to the code, so there's no issue with knowing their URL, e.g. Collaborated with: Lionel Messi - URL: github.com/what-a-worldcup.

# Self Evaluation

>**Note**
> Do not exceed 500 words for each Part. This is indicative, no need to have 500 words, and it's not a strict limit.

## Part 1
#### Self Evaluated Marks (3 marks):
0
> Please replace the above 0 with the mark you think you earned for this part. Consider how many (yours/ours) tests pass, the quality of your code, what you learnt, and [mainly for the final task] the quality of the tests that you wrote
#### Code Performance
This graph is just an example of how you can include your plots in markdown. **Please remove it in your final submission**

> Please explain the code performance of your solution. You can create a video, include figures, tables, etc. Make sure to complement them with text explaining the performance.

#### Learning and Challenges
> Before doing this part, I have practiced on the question of UC berkely project. During this process, I have fimillared with search.py, searchAgent.py, pacman.py and pacmanAgent.py.

#### Ideas That Almost Worked Well

> If you tried ideas that did not make it to the final code, please include them here and explain why they didn't make it.

#### Justification


> Please state the reason why you have assigned yourself these marks.

#### New Tests Shared @ ED

> Tell us about your testcases and why were they useful

## Part 2
#### Self Evaluated Marks (3 marks):
0
> Please replace the above 0 with the mark you think you earned for this part. Consider how many (yours/ours) tests pass, the quality of your code, what you learnt, and [mainly for the final task] the quality of the tests that you wrote.
#### Code Performance
> Please explain the code performance of your solution. You can create a video, include figures, tables, etc. Make sure to complement them with text explaining the performance.

#### Learning and Challenges
> Before doing this section, I have practiced on the problems of the UC Berkeley project. In the process, I familiarized myself with search.py, searchAgent.py, pacman.py, and pacmanAgent.py. They are the foundation of this project, and the questions in these three parts focus on modifying these four python files. In this part, I learned to use python to implement pseudo-code for enforced hill climbing. In this problem it is divided into two parts. One is the "Improve" method and the other is the "Enforced Hill Climbing" method.

#### Ideas That Almost Worked Well

## Part 3
#### Self Evaluated Marks (4 marks):
